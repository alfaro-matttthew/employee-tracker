# Employee Tracker

## Description

---

The Employee Tracker organizes, displays, and provides options to create new entries for the departments, roles, and employees of a company. I wanted to develop a single location where staff could access pertinent information regarding their company's staff all within a terminal based application. I chose to build this application in order to practice intergrating databases to UI and using various node.js modules like inquirer and mysql2. This application keeps company and employee data organized in a simple format. The project as a whole taught me how to write mySQL commands and how to integrate databases with JavaScript programs.

To use the application, you first type "npm run start". The user is presented with a list of options to choose from. Scroll down with the arrow keys and select the choice you would like to select by clicking the ENTER key. The choice will either present the user with the data they were looking for or it will provide them with a list of prompts of which the user will answer. To exit the application, simply choose the EXIT option.
